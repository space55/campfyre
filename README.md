# Campfyre

Campfyre is a rugged, battery-powered network‑in‑a‑box designed to keep you online when primary internet access fails. It can run off‑grid with Starlink, provide Ethernet, run a Raspberry Pi, and charge from a vehicle's 12V system. It's compact, durable, and built for travel and off‑grid use.
