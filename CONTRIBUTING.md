# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This is a small guide to keep contributions clear and respectful.

## Ground Rules

- **Be kind and respectful.** No harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks.
- **Assume good intent.** We're all here to improve the project.
- **Keep it constructive.** Feedback should be specific and actionable.

## How to Contribute

1. **Search existing issues/PRs** before opening a new one.
2. **Open an issue** to discuss big changes or new features.
3. **Fork the repo** and create a feature branch:
   - `feature/short-description`
   - `fix/short-description`
4. **Keep changes focused** and small where possible.
5. **Write clear commit messages.**

## Pull Requests

- Describe **what** changed and **why**.
- Link related issues if applicable.
- Ensure your changes don't break existing behavior.
- Keep formatting consistent with the codebase.

## Code Quality

- Follow existing style and conventions.
- Add tests if you introduce or change behavior.
- Avoid unrelated refactors in the same PR.

## Reporting Issues

When reporting an issue, include:

- Steps to reproduce
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior

## Communication

- Be respectful and patient.
- Reviewers may request changes—this is normal.

Thank you for contributing!
