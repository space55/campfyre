Welcome to the Campfyre docs. Campfyre is a rugged, battery-powered backup
internet box designed to keep you online when primary internet access fails. It
can run off-grid with Starlink, provide connectivity over Ethernet, run a
Raspberry Pi, and charge from a vehicle's 12V system.

## What Campfyre includes

- Starlink Mini for internet access and routing
- Ethernet switch for local connectivity
- Shared power bus (VBUS) feeding the switch, Starlink, and Raspberry Pi
- Power path controller that prioritizes external power while charging the
  battery
- 12V regulation with a secondary 5V supply for the Raspberry Pi
- Waterproof, radio-transparent case for durability and signal quality

## Why Campfyre

Campfyre is built for travel and off-grid use, providing an internet connection
wherever you need it. It provides reliable connectivity in a compact, rugged
form factor and is easy to assemble with basic tools.
