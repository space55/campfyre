After the Verizon outage in Jan of 2026, I wanted a backup internet connection
that I could put in a car or take with me if I needed. So I built Campfyre - a
battery-powered Starlink, Raspberry Pi, and network switch, in a water-resistant
case.

Campfyre is built into a rock-solid and water-resistant carrying case, so you
can take it into the field, wherever you like.

{{% blocks/feature icon="fab fa-github" title="Open Source" url="https://github.com/space55/campfyre" %}}

Everything is open-source, including CAD, printable files, wiring diagrams, and
component listing. Found a better way to do something? Suggest a change!

This works anywhere on Earth you can use Starlink. On a boat in the open ocean,
in a car driving through the wilderness, or on the roof of a building in a city.
